#Sort mutations into different categories. -> Have a clear table of mutations
#We only consider mutations in CDS

#Question: What categories do we have?
#   - Deletion of nucleotides(Immediately hit a stop codon)
#   - Very different sequence after deletion
#   - Duplication/deletion of a segment

# Any of the above could lead to dysfunction of gene
